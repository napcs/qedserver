QEDServer
============

You've just come across a great new client-side library that makes building richer client-side apps a breeze. It has support for client-side storage, but you're really interested in using this with an existing server-side web application, so you decide to try it out. Then you realize that to test everything, you need a backend. That means you need to write some server side code, set up a database, and you need to deploy the thing on a web server so that all the AJAX requests work right. And of course, you need to populate that database with dummy data. That's a lot of work just to try out a new framework!

QEDServer solves those pesky problems for you so you can focus on sharpening your front-end skills. In one small package, you get a simple web server that hosts a small "product catalog" web application and a database full of existing products. You can immediately start writing code against its RESTLike API that responds with JSON and XML.

You put your files in the `public` folder that QEDServer creates, visit http://localhost:8080/index.html in your browser, and you can start coding against this simple backend without worrying about server setup or same-origin-policy issues.

Additionally, QEDServer provides a web interface of its own that you can use to manage the stock data and add your own records. 

And if you need a fresh start, just delete the `products.sqlite3` file and restart QEDServer. The database will be recreated
so you'll have a clean environment again.

Customized Builds From Source
-------
If you're reading this far, you're probably interested in getting the source and customizing this to meet your needs.

You'll need JRuby. I recommend using RVM.

Then, 

    bundle
    ./start
    
This will run 'rackup' and load the server at http://localhost:9292. It's quicker to do this during development than it is to build the WAR file.

To run QEDServer under Java, you can generate QEDServer as a war file:
    
    rake war
    
Then you can install the WAR file on any server you'd like.

#### Building Standalone QED
To build a cross-platform standalone distribution, build the war and get the sandbox created:

    rake war config_jetty install_qed
    
This creates the `sandbox/` folder where you can test things out. Run it with

    server.bat
    
on Windows or

    sh server.sh

To zip the whole thing up to make a release, simply use
   
    rake build_release

This builds the war, rebuilds a fresh sandbox, and creates the zip file for distribution. It grabs `END_USER_README.md` and throw it in the archive.

### The files
QED Server is just a Sinatra application wrapped by Warbler, so to customize it, just replace the guts. Add your own models, change the routes around, do what you need to do.

* `lib/server.rb` is the main Sinatra application.
* `lib/extensions/` contains extensions to Ruby classes.
* `lib/configuration.rb` is the code that sets up the database connections and location of the public directory by looking at where the user started up the app. 
* `lib/seed_data.rb` is just a Ruby script that loads data into the database when the server starts.
* `lib/views` contains the view files for the various pages
* `lib/models` contains the ActiveRecord models this app uses.
* `lib/controllers` contains the routes and responders for the main parts of the app
* `lib/helpers` has all the helper functions used in the views
